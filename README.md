# Internet-Archive

## Problem Description
As new effort in our mission towards “Universal Access to All Knowledge”, the Internet Archive
is attempting to collect and provide perpetual access to the “scholarly web”: the public record of
research publications and datasets available on the world wide web, interlinked by both
hyperlinks (URLs) and citations. We have a specific focus on “long-tail” open access works
(which may be published in non-English language, outside North America or Europe, in nonSTEM disciplines, from small or informal publishers, not assigned DOIs, not archived in existing
preservation networks, etc).
